# PATH-FINDING 

* Just a simple path finding algorithm project. Using A* algorithm.
* Developed with c++ and cmake.

## Summary

The method is simple. 
Maps that fit a set size are randomly generated. 
The number of obstacles in the map may be determined arbitrarily. 
The start and arrival points are also randomly set.

## Problems

### Time

Execution time is the biggest problem. 
I still think it's not enough. 
So, the idea that I came up with is to first search with a large piece and then search with a small piece.
Time will be shortened. 
Maybe...

### Memory

I'm still not good at managing memory. 
So there seems to be a problem with the memory of the program. 
This seems especially true when creating an array of object pointers.
I am planning to fix it while studying about memory.
